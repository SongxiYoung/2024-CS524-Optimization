    "\n",
    "3. Many homeworks require the use of Julia and JuMP. We'll provide instructions to help you install this programming environment on your own computer, together with tutorials and exercises, but ultimate it is your responsibility to ensure that you have a stable platform on which to develop and run Julia code and jupyter notebooks. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Submission of all homeworks will be through Canvas. You will usually be required to submit a **pdf printout of your jupyter notebook**, NOT source code. \n",

    "    a. Please submit the answers **in the same order as on the assignment**\n",
    "\n",
    "    b. Please denote the start of each question in your notebook using a large font, for example:\n",
    "    # Question 1a\n",
    "\n",

    "5. You can learn to do optimization modeling only by doing it yourself, not by following along what others are doing!\n",
